Do you need to build scalable distributed low latency apps but don't know where to start?

All you need is a Java Virtual Machine. Vert.x 3 combines the power of reactive programming, clusterable message driven architecture and a polyglot API to make that a reality. This talk presents the key concepts of Vert.x and how you can use it to build your next application. This session explains how the simple model promoted by Vert.x enables the construction of concurrent, scalable and efficient applications.
