What if someone told you that you could use the full capacity of your server? That you could have the same performance on the backend as your react frontend? Don't you believe it? That you could choose the best language/tool for the task and you were not limited by what you already know?

In this talk, I'll show you that you can use the full power of React on the frontend and Vert.x on the backend. You will see a fast full stack development workflow with Rollup/Webpack + Babel + React. How you can mix JavaScript with any other language. Build microservice applications in minutes.
