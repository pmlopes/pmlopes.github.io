bio: >
  I'm Paulo and I've used my 10+ years of software development experience
  writing, rewriting, banging my head against the wall, editing and
  re-editing high-performance web application to make Vert.x an even more
  awesome framework. I am also the author of "yoke" and other small open
  source projects. I jump out of bed with a big smile on my face each
  morning because I know reactive microservices are real and will finally
  put monoliths and big balls of mud to an end.

  This is more than a job; I'm on a mission to build fast and faster
  applications!
